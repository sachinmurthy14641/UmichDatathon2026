**_Problem Statement:_**  
Do long-run state tax structures act as implicit incentive systems that “train” the economic composition and demographic evolution of states over time?

**_Testable Hypothesis:_**  
Persistent exposure to specific tax-based incentive signals is associated with systematic, directional changes in state economic composition and demographic structure that cannot be explained solely by national trends or short-term shocks.  
  
In other words, we would be testing whether persistent fiscal signals precede and predict structural change, regardless of whether policymakers intended them to.

**_Our final deliverable would answer the following:_**  
Is it more plausible that tax systems are passive mirrors of the economy, or active long-run incentive environments?

**_Conceptual Model:_**  
Note: we would be modeling each U.S. state as a dynamic system, whose system configuration (tax structure, economy, demographics) evolves over time through a feedback loop.

```
Entity (U.S. State)
↓
System configuration at time t: measured by the feature set
↓
Tax Structure (signals)
↓
Relative Economic Payoffs (implicit incentives) … think of this like hidden layers
↓
Behavioral Adaptation (firms, workers, households) … how the system learns over time
↓
Economic Composition + Demographics
↓
Next-period Tax Base (changed tax base influencing future signals)
```

**_Why would policymakers care?:_**  
Shows how tax systems can be treated as long-run system design choices, not just revenue tools.
